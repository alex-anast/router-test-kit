# Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to refine the examples directory and finalize test separation.

## 1. Refined the `examples/` Directory

### Removed sys.path Manipulation
- **Files Modified:** `examples/example1_connect.py`, `examples/example2_ping_between_vms.py`
- **Changes Made:**
  - Removed `sys.path.insert()` hack that was needed before the package was installable
  - Updated imports to use proper package imports: `from router_test_kit.device import LinuxDevice`
  - Cleaned up unused imports (`sys`, `os`, `time`)

### Updated to Use Secure SSH Connections
- **Files Modified:** `examples/example1_connect.py`, `examples/example2_ping_between_vms.py`
- **Changes Made:**
  - Replaced `TelnetConnection` with `SSHConnection` to reflect security best practices
  - Updated comments and docstrings to reflect SSH usage
  - Fixed IP address reference in example2 (was using `connection2.destination_ip`, now uses hardcoded IP)

### Improved Documentation
- **File Modified:** `examples/README.md`
- **Changes Made:**
  - Completely rewrote the README with proper structure and descriptions
  - Added detailed setup requirements for each example
  - Listed features demonstrated by each example
  - Added reference to the new advanced IPSec examples
  - Added installation note about editable mode installation

## 2. Finalized Test Separation

### Moved IPSec Tests to Examples
- **Files Moved:**
  - `tests/test_ipsec.py` → `examples/advanced_ipsec_test/test_ipsec.py`
  - `tests/configs_ipsec/` → `examples/advanced_ipsec_test/configs_ipsec/`

### Created Advanced IPSec Test Directory
- **New Directory:** `examples/advanced_ipsec_test/`
- **New File:** `examples/advanced_ipsec_test/README.md`
- **Purpose:** 
  - Showcase the framework's capabilities with real-world examples
  - Demonstrate advanced usage patterns
  - Maintain separation between unit tests and examples

### Updated Tests Directory Documentation
- **File Modified:** `tests/README.md`
- **Changes Made:**
  - Clarified the purpose of the tests directory (unit tests for the framework)
  - Explained the separation of concerns between tests and examples
  - Added structure overview for unit tests
  - Added instructions for running tests
  - Removed outdated IPSec test documentation and tables

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Cleaner Import Structure:** Examples now use proper package imports, making them more professional and easier to understand.

2. **Security Best Practices:** Examples now demonstrate SSH connections instead of less secure Telnet connections.

3. **Clear Separation of Concerns:** 
   - `tests/` directory is now exclusively for testing the router-test-kit framework itself
   - `examples/` directory contains usage examples and showcases
   - Advanced examples are properly organized in subdirectories

4. **Better Documentation:** Each directory now has comprehensive documentation explaining its purpose and contents.

5. **Easier Maintenance:** The new structure makes it easier to maintain and extend both the test suite and the examples.

## Verification

- All imports work correctly with the installed package
- No syntax errors or linting issues remain
- Directory structure is clean and logical
- Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
