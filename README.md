# Router Test Kit

The motivation for this project is to provide a simple and out-of-the-box, easy-to-use framework for testing (virtual) routers. Initially, the framework was designed to work with OneOS6 routers from OneAccess Networks. It is based on a telnet connection, therefore it is compatible with CISCO routers, Ubuntu Server images etc.

## Description

Virtual Router Test Kit is a Python framework for testing routers. It is based on a telnet connection (py-package: `telnetlib`). The framework is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a focus on the most common operations that are performed on a router.

The project is inspired based on the OneOS6 devices of OneAccess Networks (very similar to CISCO), but it is not limited by them. It has been extended to support Ubuntu Server images, and it can be easily extended to support other devices as well, as long as they support a telnet connection.

The easiest way to try it out is to set up two (or more) Virtual Machines and interact with them with the help of this framework. Examples of that, basic and complex, are shown in the [Examples](#examples) section.

## Installation

The project is available on PyPi, so you can install it using `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install router-test-kit
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install it locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:alex-anast/router-test-kit.git
```

## Usage

Assuming that the prerequisites are met and the installation has been successful, you can start using the test framework right away.

For a more in-detail section, see [the documentation page](https://alex-anast.github.io/router-test-kit/usage/).

## Features

### `device.py`

- **Device Abstraction**:
  - Provides an abstract base class (`Device`) to represent various types of network devices.
- **LinuxDevice Support**:
  - Implements Linux-based devices (`LinuxDevice`), including support for user and root-level access.
- **OneOS6Device Support**:
  - Implements OneOS6 device support with built-in interfaces and specific configurations for this device type.
- **RADIUS Server Device**:
  - Implements a specific `RADIUSServer` class based on the `LinuxDevice` for managing RADIUS servers.
- **Device Credential Management**:
  - Supports the use of default or custom credentials (username and password) for all device types.
- **Command Execution on Host Device**:
  - Executes shell commands on the host machine using the `HostDevice.write_command` method, with optional logging and error handling.

### `connection.py`

- **Connection Abstraction**:
  - Provides an abstract base class (`Connection`) for managing network connections between devices.
- **Telnet Connection Support**:
  - Implements a `TelnetConnection` class to establish and manage Telnet connections to devices.
- **Telnet CLI Connection Support**:
  - Supports creating Telnet CLI connections (`TelnetCLIConnection`) from a device already connected via Telnet.
- **Connection Management**:
  - Facilitates connection management, including establishing, checking, and terminating Telnet sessions.
- **Command Execution**:
  - Supports sending commands to devices and retrieving their responses via Telnet, with built-in timeout handling.
- **Root Access for Linux Devices**:
  - Supports switching to root user (`sudo su`) and managing root-level operations on Linux devices.
- **Network Interface Management**:
  - Allows setting and deleting IP addresses on network interfaces of Linux devices.
- **Configuration Management**:
  - Supports loading, patching, and unloading configurations on OneOS devices.
- **Ping and Network Testing**:
  - Provides ping functionality for both Linux and OneOS devices, and supports extended network testing with hping3 on Linux devices.

### `static_utils.py`

- **Test Collection**:
  - Includes a pytest plugin (`TestCollector`) to collect and manage test items during test runs.
- **JSON File Loading**:
  - Supports loading configurations from JSON files via the `load_json` function.
- **Banner Printing**:
  - Provides `print_banner` for printing structured banners with custom messages, useful for logging or test outputs.
- **Shell Command Execution**:
  - Allows execution of multiple shell commands on the host device, with optional output logging and error handling.
- **Network Interface Management**:
  - Functions to set and remove IP addresses on network interfaces of devices (`set_interface_ip`, `del_interface_ip`).
- **Rebooting Devices**:
  - Provides a method to reboot a device and wait for it to become available again (reboot_device).
- **Network Testing**:
  - Offers `ping` and `get_packet_loss` functions to perform network reachability tests and measure packet loss.
- **File Transfer**:
  - Supports transferring files to a device using SCP (`scp_file_to_home_dir`), with error handling for missing tools like `sshpass`.
