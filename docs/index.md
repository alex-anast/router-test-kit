# Router Test Kit

The motivation for this project is to provide a simple and out-of-the-box, easy-to-use framework for testing (virtual) routers. Initially, the framework was designed to work with OneOS6 routers from OneAccess Networks. It is based on a telnet connection, therefore it is compatible with CISCO routers, Ubuntu Server images etc.

For Demo purposes, we use two Ubuntu Server Virtual Machines. See the DEMO section on the front page.
